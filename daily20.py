zip
The zip object yields n-length tuples, where n is the number of iterables
  passed as positional arguments to zip().  The i-th element in every tuple
 comes from the i-th iterable argument to zip().  This continues until the
 shortest argument is exhausted.

slice
     Assuming a sequence of length len, calculate the start and stop
     indices, and the stride length of the extended slice described by
     S. Out of bounds indices are clipped in a manner consistent with the
     handling of normal slices.
Sum
(iterable, /, start=0)
    Return the sum of a 'start' value (default: 0) plus an iterable of numbers
    
    When the iterable is empty, return the start value.
    This function is intended specifically for use with numeric values and may
    reject non-numeric types.
